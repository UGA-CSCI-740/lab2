# Lab2

## Goal
You will be using a template workspace for Zephyr. These templates will be the frameworks for every project you do from now on. This lab will help you understand how the workspaces are used and created. It will also help you understand the pipline used to building, testing and deplying your Zephyr code.

## What you have to do
- [ ] Build the hello world example project
- [ ] Run it on QEMU
- [ ] Run it on Arduino
- [ ] Change the program to print "hello world" every second using a single thread
